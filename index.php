						<h2>Welcome to TSecurity's File Inclusion BOX (FIBox)</h2>
						<small><p>A File inclusion vulnerability is a type of vulnerability that is most commonly found to affect web applications that rely on a scripting run time. This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control which file is executed at run time. Successful exploitation of a file include vulnerability will result in remote code execution on the web server that runs the affected web application.</p></small>
